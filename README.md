# 🛠️ CNC & VMC G-Code Library

Welcome to the **CNC & VMC G-Code Library**, a curated collection of real-world **G-code files** and **3D STL models** for various machining jobs. Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or professional machinist, this repository provides practical examples for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) and VMC (Vertical Machining Center) operations.

````

Each `Job_X` folder includes:

* 📜 A `G-code` file for the machine
* 🧱 A `.stl` 3D model representing the output part from the code

## 🔍 Sample Output Preview

Here’s a rendered STL preview of one of the job outputs (e.g., CNC/Job\_1):

> **Note:** This preview is only a visual reference.
> Actual results may vary depending on:
>
> * 📏 **Workpiece dimensions**
> * 🪵 **Workpiece material**
> * 🎯 **Zero-set origin points**
> * 🧾 **Machine calibration and post-processor**

Always simulate the G-code in your CAM software before executing on a real machine.
